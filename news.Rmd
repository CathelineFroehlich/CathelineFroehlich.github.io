"If you’ve ever dived on a coral reef, you may have peeked into a staghorn coral and seen small fish whizzing through its branches. But few realise that these small fish, such as tiny goby fish, play a crucial role in helping corals weather the storm of climate change..."

# Corals and goby fishes showing signs of recovery at Lizard Island
"Corals and goby fishes are slowly recovering, less than 3 years after the devastating climatic events that occurred at Lizard Island. While this is great news for Lizard Island, more recovery time is needed. The last 5 years have been rough for the reef, with two consecutive cyclones and two back-to-back mass bleaching events taking place..."

# Sea nursery: Man-made reef aimed at saving red snapper
"Studies conducted at UTRGV determined that juvenile fish need a habitat that is smaller, and separate from the larger reefs, in order to have a safe environment from predators.
'We’re hoping to increase the number of red snapper and aid the fisheries in general,' said Catheline Froehlich, who holds a master of science in biology from UTRGV legacy institution UTB/TSC. 'They have a lot of pressure right now from overfishing.'"
